**A game about a little brave girl saving pets.**

This is my first project as Ironhack Web Development student. 
I wanted to create a cute, funny game and learn as much as possible about sprites and background creation and the logic behind a platform video game.

![game_example](<img width="749" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91290073/148744919-d774cc3a-5491-44a2-a963-f7ba146ee1b3.png">)


I really enjoyed the process of creating sprites and stuff and add movement to background elements. The most difficult issue I had to face was the logic behind collision between player and things, so I added different items to reach and to avoid in order to learn more about how it worked. It has been funny and challenging in equal parts!

Please, let me know if you enjoyed it and ask me anything you´ll like to know about the creation process.

Thanks for playing!
