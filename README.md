**A game about a little brave girl saving pets.**

This is my first project as Ironhack Web Development student. 
I wanted to create a cute, funny game and learn as much as possible about sprites and background creation and the logic behind a platform video game. Play it is easy: just use the arrows left and right to move and press the up key to jump.

I really enjoyed the process of creating sprites, choosing the stuff and adding movement to background elements. The most difficult issue I had to face was keeping the player on the islands after jumping; I solved it playing with the maximum height reached after jump. It has been funny and challenging in equal parts!

Please, let me know if you enjoyed Bunnies Story and ask me anything you´ll like to know about the creation process.

Thanks for playing!
